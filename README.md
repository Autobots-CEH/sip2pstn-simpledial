# A sample Twilio app for customers sending SIP to Twilio and wishing to dial to PSTN or to dial a SIP URI.
Now a Twilio customer can simply do 1-click deployment of the app to Heroku and configure a single Voice URL in the console with a Twilio provisioned phone number and a customer can place calls from their favorite SIP Endpoint to anywhere in the world.

## Features

Twilio requires that phone numbers be in E.164 format. To relax this restriction, this app allows the following more intuitive and convenient formats.
The following formats for phone-number are supported:
1) E.164 format - i.e. +14157664555
2) US domestic formats - i.e. 14157664555,4157664555
3) Any time 011 exit code from US - i.e. 0114415627220000
4) SIP URI - i.e. username@somedomain.com

The previously mentioned formats can be used when you enter a phone number in your SIP endpoint (i.e. Bria or Zoiper iPhone app).

Some conversion examples
Origination | Termination | National format     |  E.164 (Twilio format)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
USA         | USA         |        415 555 2671 |  +14155552671
UK          | UK          |       0 207183 8750 |  +442071838750
USA         | UK          |  011 44 207183 8750 |  +442071838750
