### [Instructions to configure your SIP Endpoint](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/twilio-sip/pv-sip-registration#configure-your-sip-endpoint)

## Why connect your phone to Twilio?
1. No contracts or monthly charges. You just pay low charges for calls you make or receive.
2. No cost to register your IP phone with Twilio so you can receive calls.
3. You can instantly provision a local telephone number in 50 countries to give you local presence
4. Build custom call handling logic so you can be reached on the right device at the right time in the right place

## Features
Twilio requires that phone numbers be in E.164 format. To relax this restriction, this app allows the following more commonly known formats.
Each of the following formats are supported. It is assumed the calls originate from US.
1. E.164 format - i.e. +14157664555
2. US domestic formats - i.e. 14157664555,4157664555
3. Any time 011 exit code from US - i.e. 0114415627220000
4. SIP URI - i.e. sip:username@somedomain.com

The previously mentioned formats can be used when you enter a phone number in your SIP Endpoint (i.e. Bria or Zoiper iPhone app).

Some conversion examples:

Origination | Termination | National format     |  E.164 (Twilio format)
------------|-------------|---------------------|-----------------------
USA         | USA         |        415 555 2671 |  +14155552671
UK          | UK          |       0 207183 8750 |  +442071838750
USA         | UK          |  011 44 207183 8750 |  +442071838750


## Usage

There exists a route /voice that contains you can augment for more advanced call handling. 
You can edit `hackpack/app.py`.

This app solves a specific voice use case. If you want a more generic app that let's you play with both Voice and SMS then please see: Twilio-Hackpack-for-Heroku-and-Flask
